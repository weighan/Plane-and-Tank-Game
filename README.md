# Plane and Tank Games

This is a pair of games that were made for a project in one of my CS classes.  The goal was to reuse some of the classes between games to practice "reusable code".

For both games:

    Player 1: use WASD to move and SPACE to shoot

    Player 2: use 8456 on the numpad to move and right arrow key to shoot
